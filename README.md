# 🧠 Learning Redux Toolkit – State Management Journey

This repository documents my learning journey of **Redux Toolkit** for modern and efficient state management in React applications. I practiced with two projects to understand the core concepts and application structure.

## 📁 Projects

### 1. `counter-with-redux`

🔢 A basic **counter app** built to understand the foundational concepts of Redux Toolkit:

- ✅ Setting up and configuring the Redux **store**
- ✅ Creating a **slice** with reducers and actions
- ✅ Using **Provider** to inject the store into the app
- ✅ Accessing state using `useSelector` and updating state using `useDispatch`

> This project gave me a strong introduction to Redux Toolkit with a simple and clear use case.

---

### 2. `create-post-redux`

📝 A simple **post creation app** that goes one step further to show real-world usage:

- 🏗️ Project structure with multiple components and modular code
- 🔁 Understanding **data flow** in Redux: from user input to state and UI
- 📦 Managing state in a centralized way for better maintainability
- ✨ Demonstrates how Redux logic and UI logic can be separated

> This project helped me learn how to structure Redux code properly in a real application.

## 🚀 What I Learned

- ✅ Core Redux Toolkit concepts: `createSlice`, `configureStore`
- ✅ Dispatching actions and selecting state
- ✅ Organizing code in scalable architecture
- ✅ Understanding unidirectional data flow
- ✅ Importance of state centralization for predictable behavior
